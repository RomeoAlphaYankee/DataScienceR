# DataScienceR
Data Science Scripts.  

Some examples of code I have written while working through various data science challenges. These include data manipulation, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, and various modeling techniques.

The app.R is a Shiny web app which takes user input, and then summarizes and plots the gapminder dataset from the World Health Organization. It is also deployed at https://rmathis.shinyapps.io/shiny/
