# DataScienceR
Data Science Scripts.  

Some examples of code I have written while working through various data science challenges. These include data manipulation, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, and various modeling techniques.

The app.R is a Shiny web app which takes user input, and then summarizes and plots the gapminder dataset from the World Health Organization. It is also deployed at https://rmathis.shinyapps.io/shiny/

The PitchingWebApp.R is an interactive, situational pitching scouting report. It uses data from the PITCHfx database and presents the data in an easily understood format based upon parameters entered in real time. It is also deployed at https://rmathis.shinyapps.io/PITCHfxWebApp/
